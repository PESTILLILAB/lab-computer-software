# lab-computer-software
This repository contains code for installing some of the most important software for our lab, including apptainer/docker, freesurfer, fsl, connectome workbench, python packages (nibabel, numpy, dipy, pandas, etc), and to set up remote desktop capabilities.

To run this installer script:
```
. ./lab-computer-software-install.sh
```

NOTE: this is currently a work in progress. This might not work fresh out of the box.
